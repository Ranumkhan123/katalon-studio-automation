# Katalon Studio Web Automation Project

This repository contains a collection of web UI automated tests built with [Katalon Studio](https://katalon.com/). It is designed for practicing, demonstrating automation frameworks, and showcasing test execution through test cases, test suites, and suite collections.

---

##  Project Overview

- Web automation testing project created with **Katalon Studio**
- Demonstrates the use of **record mode**, **manual mode**, and **script mode** for test design
- Covers test structures like **test cases**, **test suites**, and **test suite collections**
- Executes suite collections **sequentially** on **Chrome and Firefox** for cross-browser validation
- Generates detailed **logs** and **HTML reports** for execution analysis
- Uses **custom keywords** to promote code reuse and improve test maintainability
- Implements **test listeners** to extend functionality (e.g., take screenshot on test failure)
- Utilizes **variables** and **profiles** to support test configuration and data-driven testing

## Features

- Automated browser-based UI testing    
- Test suite and suite collection execution  
- Object Repository for element centralization  
- Environment profiles for flexible test config

## Key Features Used

This project demonstrates the use of several core features in Katalon Studio:

###  Test Design Modes

- ** Record Mode:** Used to capture user interactions and auto-generate test steps.
- ** Manual Mode:** Used to manage test steps in a readable, tabular format.
- ** Script Mode:** Used for editing Groovy-based test scripts for flexibility and control.

###  Test Artifacts

- **Test Cases:** Organized and modular test scripts for different functionalities.
- **Test Suites:** Grouped related test cases to enable regression or feature-based testing.
- **Test Suite Collections:** Combined multiple suites for broader test coverage.

###  Cross-Browser Sequential Execution

- Suite collections are configured to run **sequentially on Chrome and Firefox**.
- This ensures cross-browser compatibility and consistent behavior across environments.

###  Logs & Reports

- Execution reports are auto-generated under the `Reports/` directory.
- Includes **detailed logs**, **pass/fail status**, **screenshots (on failure)**, and **HTML summaries**.

###  Custom Keywords

- Created reusable functions in the `/Keywords/` directory for cleaner test logic.
- Used in script and manual mode to simplify repetitive tasks.

###  Variables & Test Data

- Used **local and global variables** to parameterize test cases.
- Managed test data using Katalon’s built-in data binding features.

###  Test Listeners

- Implemented listeners to monitor test execution lifecycle.
- **Custom listener added to automatically take a screenshot when a test case fails**.
- Located under the `Listeners/` directory.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Katalon Studio** – Main automation tool used for creating and running tests
- **Groovy / Java** – Scripting language for test logic and custom keywords
- **Selenium WebDriver (built-in via Katalon)** – For browser automation
- **Chrome & Firefox** – Browsers used for cross-browser testing
- **Git** – Version control system to track changes in the test project
- **HTML Reports & Logs** – Automatically generated by Katalon for test execution results


##  Prerequisites

- [Katalon Studio](https://katalon.com/) (v8.6.5 or newer recommended)  
- Java 8 or newer  
- Chrome/Firefox browser installed  
- Git (optional, for version control)
